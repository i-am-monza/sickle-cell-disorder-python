# sickle-cell-disorder-python
A program that computes a given DNA sequence either through keyboard input or reading a text file document. The program transverse through the given input then determines if the DNA sequence is subjective to the sickle cell disorder. 

## DNA.txt
This is a text file containing a dna sequence of over 600 characters. This file is read and examined by the program, sorted then processed. The processing is determining whether the sequence is susceptible to the sickle cell disorder.

## normalDNA and mutatedDNA
Certain text files are created depending on the processed outcome. Mutated dna is dna thats changed by the program, then written to textfile. Normal dna is dna sequence just written to text file.

## slc.txt
This is the single-letter data-base codes for the amino acids formed and corresponding base-pairs obtained from the processed information. These codes are what determine if the sequence is susceptible to the sickle cell disorder.

## SickleCellDisease.py
This is the source code for the program in a .py file.
